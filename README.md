# TravelMap

Travel Map is a react typescript web app in which I'll keep track of my travels and the places I've visited. The web app shows a map with markers of the places I've visited. When you hover on a marker, it shows a tooltip with the name of the place and the date I visited it. The tooltip allows to see a gallery of pictures of the place and also allow to see each photo / video in a slide show.

## How to use it

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the app with `npm start`
